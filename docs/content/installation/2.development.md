5. <badge style="margin: 0">Install</badge> Download the codebase and install the npm dependencies.
6. <badge style="margin: 0">Install</badge> Bootstrap the database.

## Environment & Tooling

Complete steps `1` through `3` in the [development requirements](/installation/development#requirements) by visiting the [environment guide](/tools/environment) to obtain the following:

- Node.js `14.X.X` installation.
- Git or GitHub compatible Git client.
- Visual Studio Code with the [recommended extensions](/tools/environment#extensions).
- Insomnia or similar endpoint testing client.
- Docker and Docker Compose or other PostgreSQL credentials.
- DataGrip or other database management tool.

## Downloading & Install

In this step the application will be downloaded and the `npm` dependencies installed.

1.  Download the repository using Git. This will make a folder called `omc`, though you may change it.

    <code-group>
      <code-block label="SSH" active>

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:duckies/omc-app.git omc
    ```

      </code-block>
      <code-block label="HTTPS">

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/duckies/omc-app.git omc
    ```

      </code-block>
    </code-group>

    <alert type="info">

    If you plan on publishing changes made to the application a fork will need to be made. The fork button can be found at the top of the [repo](https://github.com/duckies/omc-app). If a fork is already made for a team of yours, use that instead.

    </alert>

2.  Install the `frontend` dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ./omc/frontend && npm install
    ```

3.  Install the `backend` dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ../backend && npm install
    ```

4.  Copy the default avatars and event picture to the static directory.

    ```bash
    # This is assuming you're in the /omc/backend directory!
    cp -R ../resources/images ../../uploads
    ```

    You should end up with an `uploads` folder at the same level as the `omc` folder.

While there is a `package.json` file in the root of the repository it references no dependencies. Avoid accidentally trying to manage `npm` dependencies in the root of the project.

## Services

The three external services â€” `PayPal`, `SendGrid`, and `Twitter` need to be configured to initialize the application in a development mode. Acquire access to the credentials for each and save them as described in the following [configuration](/installation/development#configuration) section.

- **PayPal** credentials need to be configured or the application will not start. Visit the [PayPal services setup](/installation/services#paypal) guide for obtaining credentials.
- **Twitter** has a lengthy application process for obtaining credentials described in the [Twitter service setup](/installation/services#twitter) guide. The previous team has a Twitter account approved for the application already and can provide the credentials to you.
- **SendGrid** has multiple development options described in the [SendGrid service setup](/installation/services#sendgrid). In sandbox mode, emails are printed to the console. Eventually, a free-tier personal account should be used to test the email formatting.

<alert type="warning">

The configuration system has bugs and unintended behaviors as of writing this.

- You may enter anything to bypass the `TWITTER_KEY` and `TWITTER_SECRET` requirement and the rest of the application will work, just not load any tweets.

- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is still incorrectly required when using `SENDGRID_IN_DEV` mode to print emails to the console.

</alert>

## Configuration

The dual `frontend` and `backend` servers found in their respective folders require `.env` files to be created within them and supplied with environment variables. For a list of all of the available environment variables you can visit the [configuration](/installation/configuration) page or view the `./frontend/nuxt.config.ts` and `./backend/src/app.config.ts` files. For development not many will need to be provided as there are defaults that can be used locally.

<alert type="info">

Some operating systems do not show file extensions by default. This can make working with a `.env` file annoying.

- [Show filename extensions on Mac](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#rules)
- [Show filename extensions on Windows](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/show-file-extensions-in-windows)

</alert>

1. While still in the backend directory, create a `.env` file and fill it with, at minimum, these options.

   ```bash
   # Random string of alphanumerics and special characters.
   SECRET=dev-example
   # Have the backend serve images and file uploads
   SERVE_STATIC=true
   # From the PayPal Developer Portal
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=
   # Twitter Developer Portal
   TWITTER_KEY=
   TWITTER_SECRET=
   # SendGrid Dashboard
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=
   ```

   <alert type="info">

   All variables within a `.env` file are strings. There is no need to add quotations.

   ```bash
   # For example
   SECRET=OMC19456!@^&
   ```

   </alert>

2. Navigate into the frontend directory and create a `.env` file once again. However, the frontend will operate in a development mode using the defaults and thus can be left empty.

## Database Setup

The application requires a single PostgreSQL database to operate. If you are using Docker continue along with this section, otherwise fill in `DATABASE_*` options found on the [configuration](/installation/development#configuration) page in the `./omc/backend/.env` file as appropriate.

1. Open your terminal and point it to the root directory of the project containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Run the following command and wait for Docker to finish initializing the PostgreSQL database.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Open DataGrip and click on the `+` sign then go to `Data Source` and select `PostgreSQL` and enter the following connection information.

   | Option           | Value             |
   | ---------------- | ----------------- |
   | `Host`           | `localhost`       |
   | `Port`           | `5432`            |
   | `Authentication` | `User & Password` |
   | `User`           | `postgres`        |
   | `Password`       | `postgres`        |
   | `Database`       | `postgres`        |

4. Click on `Test Connection` and a green checkmark should indicate the connection was successful.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/installation/connection.png" />

5. Navigate to the `Schemas` tab on the toolbar above `Host` and click on `All databases`.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/installation/schemas.png" />

6. Name the connection anything you would like, then hit `OK` to save and close it.

7. On the left sidebar expand the connection you created and right click on `databases` and in the `New` submenu select `New Database`.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/installation/create-db.png" />

8. Name the database `omc` then lick `OK` and exit DataGrip once the new database is created.

   You can rename the database, say for other testing environments, but the `DATABASE_NAME` environment variable will need to be configured.

9. Navigate to the `backend` folder and run the following command to test the connection and create the database schema.

   <code-group>
     <code-block label="Docker" active>

   ```bash
   npx mikro-orm schema:create -r
   ```

     </code-block>
     <code-block label="Remote">

   ```bash
   # Use if you are connecting to an external database, e.g. Azure
   npx mikro-orm schema:create -r --fk-checks
   ```

     </code-block>
   </code-group>

## Initialization

Now that we have the application, its dependencies, and the database it can be started.

1. While still in the `backend` directory run the following command.

```build
npm run start:dev
```

2. Open a second terminal and navigate to `./omc/frontend` and run the following command.

```build
npm run dev
```

3. The backend will now be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:8080`.

<alert type="warning">

The development build of the frontend can take a considerable amount of time as it initially turns on. It may appear to hang but it is still working.
